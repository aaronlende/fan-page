        Sound the Gjallerhorn! Minnesota Vikings fans have a place to come for all news related to the Minnesota Vikings and perhaps a spot of history while they're at it. Fans have stuck with the team and cheered them on through many seasons both good and bad. Lucky for us however, it looks like the next decade holds some promising results.

    <h2> Quarterback Goes Down in Practice, Out for Season!</h2>
    <p> The Vikings quarterback Teddy Bridgewater went down with a non-contact injury the other day in practice, resulting in a torn ACL and an out for season diagnosis from the medical staff. This means either a backup previously working with Teddy, or the newly aquired Sam Bradford will have to step in a fill some highly anticipated shoes. The Vikings have few choices for starting QBs, among them is:
        <ui>
            <li>Sam Bradford
                <li>Shaun Hill
                    <li>Joel Stave (Practice Squad)</li>

        </ui>

    <h2>Professional Predictions for the 2016 season.</h2>

    <p>ESPN writer Ben Goessling is predicting a winning schedule for this season, at <a href="http://www.espn.com/blog/minnesota-vikings/post/_/id/19916/vikings-playoff-status-could-be-decided-by-big-games-at-u-s-bank-stadium">Vikings Schedule Prediction</a>People are already counting the Vikings out of the playoff race as a whole. This is clearly a mistake as we have a Super Bowl caliber defense. I tend to agree with Ben Goessling's predictions of a 10-6 regular season record. Without a doubt losing Teddy Bridgewater is going to hurt the Vikings and possibly cause some unforseen losses. This however, does not mean the Vikings are out of playoff, or even Super Bowl contention by any means. Our defense will have to be ready to do some extra weight lifting to get ready for carrying the team. Offensive standouts like Adrian Peterson and Stefon Diggs will have to "dig deep" and really try to get the offense into a good groove. Sorry, pun was intended.
